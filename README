A Repository detailing my coding and engineering projects and labs during my time at UCSC and at WVC/MC.

The coding files are from computer science and electrical engineering courses, while the engineering files are from
physics labs and engineering and electrical engineering courses.

The READMEs provide class and project/lab descriptions, as well as additional information about which files are present.
Work that is not my own (i.e. working with lab partners) is for the most part left out.
