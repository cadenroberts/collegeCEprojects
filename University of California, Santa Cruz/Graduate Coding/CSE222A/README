Lab 1 - Terms and Review
Review basic circuit laws, cell and CMOS terms.

Lab 2 - KLayout and Spice
Learn how to read spice netlists and draw CMOS circuits from logic statements, .gds files, and .spice files.

Lab 3 - KLayout, DRC, LVS and Ngspice
Learn basic skills with editing and verifying standard cell layouts. You will also gain experience running
spice to simulation standard cells.

Lab 4 - OpenLane2
The goal of this assignment is to familiarize with the OpenLane2 HDL (Hardware Description Language) to GDS
toolchain.

Lab 5 - Static Timing Analysis
Learn basic skills with static timing analysis (STA) including analyzing critical paths, false paths, and
setting design constraints.


Lab 6 - Logical Effort
Learn basic skills with the method of logical effort.

Lab 7 - PPA
Use the OpenLane2/OpenRoad tool flow to create and improve an IBEX processor design with two banks. The IBEX
is a 32-bit RISC-V microprocessor. The RTL is provided and the configuration files must be created for the
design. The goal of this assignment is to measure Power (dynamic and leakage), Performance (clock period or
frequency) and Area (silicon chip size) after design "signoff" (which is post-routing and extraction) and
passing timing in all process corners. It is expected that each design should pass DRC and LVS. After baseline,
the design flowshould be enhanced in two different ways to improve the metrics (power, performance, area) and
measure the impact.
