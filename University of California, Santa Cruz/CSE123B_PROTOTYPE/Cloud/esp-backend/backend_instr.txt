##ENTER DB:
docker exec -it thera-hand-backend psql -U postgres

#Check DB:
\c
    you'll want to see postgres

#LIST ALL TABLES:
\dt

#FIND ALL USERS:
SELECT id, data->>'email' AS email, data->>'name' AS name, role FROM users;

#FIND USER BY EMAIL:
SELECT id, data->>'email', data->>'name', role FROM users WHERE data->>'email' = 'aliyaa@therahand.com';

#LIST ALL PATIENTS:
SELECT * FROM patients;

#SHOW ALL SESSIONS
SELECT * FROM sessions;

#FIND SESSIONS FOR A SPECIFIC PATIENT:

Find patient ID:
SELECT id FROM users WHERE data->>'email' = 'aliyaa@therahand.com';

SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE patient_id = '40eadfea-280e-463a-9e58-cc6137d1d7d4';

#SEE LATEST SESSION:
SELECT * FROM sessions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
